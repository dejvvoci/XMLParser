# XML Parser Project

## Overview
This project focuses on parsing XML content into an XML tree structure containing multiple XMLNode objects. The goal is to efficiently transform an XML document into a manageable data structure, facilitating easy manipulation and retrieval of data.

## Project Highlights

### Learning and Challenges
Working on this Java project to parse XML documents presented both challenges and learning opportunities. Initially, I faced hurdles in understanding the intricacies of XML parsing and selecting appropriate data structures. The hierarchical nature of XML required careful consideration to ensure efficient data manipulation and retrieval. Despite these difficulties, the project significantly enhanced my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of Java concepts, including working with Predicates for filtering features.

### Improvements and Performance
I have actively developed an enhanced solution for the XML parser, building upon the initial implementation with significant performance improvements. The revised parser analyzes XML content on a character-by-character basis, greatly accelerating processing speed. This optimization has been rigorously tested with large XML files, including the one available at [this link](https://nspublicforsharing.s3.amazonaws.com/standard.xml). The parser now creates the XML tree in just 1,911 milliseconds. While memory usage optimization is still in progress, the improvements in processing speed mark a significant advancement in the project's development.

## Getting Started

To use this XML parser:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the main class to parse your XML documents.

## Conclusion
This project has been a satisfying and educational experience, providing valuable insights into XML parsing and Java programming. The ongoing improvements aim to make this XML parser even more efficient and user-friendly.
